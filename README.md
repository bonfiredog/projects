# The Spare Set

This is a game which I made in 2014 for the UK housing and homelessness charity Shelter as part of their summer campaign concerning the public welfare system in Britain. It was well-received, but unfortunately not very well-publicised outside the intended audience of the charity's supporters. However, I think that it might be enjoyed even by those not based in the UK and those unaffected by the UK welfare state. 

It's called The Spare Set.

A small bit of context: Shelter was campaigning for the government to improve the so-called 'safety net' provision for families. The 'safety net' is a system of financial benefits which families can call on temporarily if they fall into fiscal difficulty. Contrary to popular belief, it is not for shirkers or lazy people, but it is hard to erode such belief, and is politically expedient to bow to it. This 'safety net' provision has been cut horrifically in recent years, to the detriment of many unnewsworthy people.

However, the need for it was, and sadly is, greater that ever; in the current economic climate, even something small can put a big dent in one's finances. Shelter's research found that after an unexpected bill, illness or job loss, a majority of UK families would only have about a month of savings available. After this, with no money to pay their mortgage bills, they would lose their home. This happens an awful lot more than most people realise, and I drew on a lot of real case studies from Shelter's work to make this game.  

I made 'The Spare Set' to allow players to experience this helplessness and frustration, and to simulate how the government's cuts might worsen an already dreadful situation.

In the game you play as Lucy, who must navigate this difficult scenario and try and make the best of it. I wanted the game to break through populist belief and sneering; Lucy is hardworking, desperate to make things right and, most of all, only human.

# The Spare Set
A Twine game made for Shelter UK, the housing and homelessness charity.

In 2014 I worked with the housing and homelessness charity, Shelter UK, to produce a Twine game to run alongside their summer campaign. It is called The Spare Set, and you can play it at the following link:

I wanted to create an experience for people to highlight the work that the charity does, as well as to draw people's attention to the issues facing many families in Britain today. 

Every 11 minutes in England, a family loses their home, usually through repossession. This is often as the result of forces outside their control; an accident at home or work, a job loss or other incident which means that they begin to find it extremely difficult to keep up with the payments on their home. In fact, the situation is so dire that many people, even if they do not know it, are only one paycheque away from losing their home. 

Shelter provides expert advice and legal representation to families at risk of losing their homes, equipping them with the tools they need to keep their lives on track. 'The Spare Set' is a fictional story of a woman named Lucy, a home-owner, office worker and mother-of-two who is in just such a situation. Players can explore her life right up until the point at which the incident occurs, and how things steadily get worse after this fact. 

This is an experiment for Shelter, a new medium through which to grow understanding and empathy for a problem which can affect anybody. I hope you enjoy the game, and if you have any constructive comments or bug-fixes, please send them to:
